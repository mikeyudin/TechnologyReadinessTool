# Technology Readiness Tool Documentation

Technology Readiness Tool (TRT) is a Java web application that stores information about resources used for online testing 
in schools.

## What is included
1. Java web application source code
    - User interface application
    - Batch file processing application
2. Database creation script

## Dependencies

- Java 1.7 (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html)
- Tomcat 7 (http://tomcat.apache.org/download-70.cgi)
- MySQL (http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/)

## Compiling Java
TRT uses Maven to compile and package the deployable binaries.

### Install Maven
Download the Maven binary (http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) or install with your package manager.

The project is made up of several sub-modules

- core-components - Shared set of classes used for batch processing and the user interface
- interface-components - JSP tag library and supporting Struts 2 extension classes
- readiness-plugin - Struts 2 actions and JSPs for reporting pages
- batch-webapp - Application responsible for executing file based processing
- readiness - Application that handles user facing functions

The standard Maven commands are supported, 'mvn clean package' builds the binaries. They are located in each of the project's
target directory.

## Configuration

Each application looks for a .properties file at startup for environment specific configuration.
- application-batch.properties - batch-webapp
- application-customer.properties - readiness

The default values for the values can be found in:
- batch-webapp/WEB-INF/application-batch-dev.properties
- readiness/WEB-INF/application-customer-dev.properties

### Properties
- cache.config: Controls the ehcache configuration file that is loaded. 'dev' is the only value that is supported, ehcache-[dev].xml is the file that is loaded.
- cache.second.level: Passthrough property to 'hibernate.cache.use_second_level_cache' when configuring the Hibernate EntityManager. 'true' and 'false' are valid values.

The app.customer.* properties are used to generate URLs for login, password reset and links in email templates

- app.customer.host: The host portion of a URL that the interface application is deployed at.
- app.customer.port: The port portion of a URL that the interface application is deployed at.
- app.customer.contextPath: The base path portion of a URL that the interface application is deployed at.
- app.customer.protocol: The protocol portion of a URL that the interface application is deployed at.

emailService* properties control how the system generates and sends emails

- emailServiceHostName: The host name of the SMTP server that should be used to send emails.
- emailServiceReplyAddress: The email address that will populate the FROM field.
- emailServiceReplyName: The name that will populate the FROM field.
- emailServiceSMTPuser: The username that is used to connect to the SMTP server.
- emailServiceSMTPpass: The password that is used to connect to the SMTP server.
- emailServiceSMTPport: The port to use to connect to the SMTP server.
- emailServiceSSLport: The SSL port to use to connect to the SMTP server.
- emailServiceUseTLS: Use TLS to connect to the SMTP server, true or false.
- emailServiceUseSSL: Use SSL to connect to the SMTP server, true or false.

- file.upload.dir: The directory that will be used to hold file uploads for batch processing.
- file.temp.export.dir: The directory that will be used for temporary files during batch processing.

- login.authentication: The type of authentication to use. Valid values are 'dev' and 'cas'. 'dev' mode does not require a password.
- cas.service.url: The service that represents the TRT to the CAS server.
- cas.login.url: The URL for the CAS login page
- cas.logout.url: The URL that invalidates CAS tickets
- cas.validator.url: The URL that validates CAS tickets
- cas.auth.key: A unique key that represents the CAS server

## Tomcat Configuration

## Properties files

The properties files described in the Configuration section can be outside of the application packages. This can be configured in Tomcat by setting a shared loader location for adding files to deployed application’s classpath. See Tomcat’s documentation about the shared loader and the ‘shared.loader’ property in the [tomcat_home]/conf/catalina.properties file.

## Database Connection Pool

The applications require a database connection pool in JNDI. This is defined in Tomcat’s context.xml file.

- [db_username]: The username of a user defined in the MySQL server.
- [db_password]: The password of the MySQL user.
- [schema_name]: The schema name that has the tables for the readiness application. This should be ‘core’. References to other schemas need to be prefixed in the query.

    <Resource auth="Container"
      driverClassName="com.mysql.jdbc.Driver"
      name="core_connection"
      username=“[db_username]”
      password=“[db_password]“
      type="javax.sql.DataSource"
      url="jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/[schema_name]“
      validationQuery="/* ping */" />

## Database
Execute the database script to create the required tables for the application. The script is ‘database.sql’. The application requires three schemas to run: core, core_batch and readiness. The core schema contains organization, device and consortia information. The core_batch schema has the tables required for dependencies on Quartz and Spring Batch. The readiness schema has tables for snapshot reporting data.
